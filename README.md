# Kuualus
*Kuualus* is Finnish and means a spacecraft on a mission to the moon, including landing on its surface.
The project is created as the assignment of our group for the module **Introduction to Game Programming**. We are the first group that is not part of the **Game Academy* at the university to develop a game project in this course.
Each group chose of existing arcade games as reference. We decided on **Thrust**, a single player arcade game where you fly a spacecraft in a 2d physics environment and destroy enemy anti-aircraft guns and pick up cargo to collect point to your score.

In our version we use more modern graphic elements and add a landing platform to receive the cargo. Inspired by **SpaceX's Falcon 9** rockets we wanted to implement the satisfying feeling of a landing rocket and combine with nostalgia for the old school classic.
